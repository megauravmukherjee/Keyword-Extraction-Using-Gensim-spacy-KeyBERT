# Keyword-Extraction-Using-Gensim-spacy-KeyBERT

Hey! This is an assignment project for Scalenut. 
In this project i have scrapped data from the websites as shown in urls.csv using BeautifulSoup.(Unfortunately I was unable to scrape website of Index 0 and 8 due to Error Response Code).
Then I have clean the data using regex and preprocessed the data , removed the stopwords.
Using gensim , i have treid to create bigrams and trigrams.
using spacy i have tired to remove the keywords which are not NOUN,ADJECTIVE,VERB,ADVERB,PROPOSITION.
and then Lemmatized the bag of words.
and printed the number of unique keywords.
